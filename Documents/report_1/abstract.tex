\begin{abstract}
A hierarchical algorithm for electing a leaders' hierarchy in an asynchronous network with dynamically changing communication topology is presented including a remoteness's constraint towards each leader. The algorithm ensures that, no matter what pattern of topology changes occur, if topology changes cease, then eventually every connected component contains a unique leaders' hierarchy. The algorithm combines ideas from the Temporally Ordered Routing Algorithm (TORA) for mobile ad hoc networks with a wave algorithm, all within the framework of a height-based mechanism for reversing the logical direction of communication links. Moreover, an improvement from the algorithm in is the introduction of logical clocks as the nodesâ€™ measure of time, instead of requiring them to have access to a common global time. This new feature makes the algorithm much more flexible and applicable to real situations, while still providing a correctness proof. It is also proved that in certain well behaved situations, a new leader is not elected unnecessarily.
