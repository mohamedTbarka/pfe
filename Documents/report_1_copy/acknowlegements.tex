I would like to thank all the members of my committee for their patience and support in overcoming numerous obstacles I have been facing through my research

I would like to thank my fellow doctoral students for their feedback, cooperation and of course friendship. In addition I would like to express my gratitude to the staff of INFRES-Télécom ParisTech for the last minute favors.

Nevertheless, I am also grateful to Mr. Petr Kuznetsov for sharing his dissertation woes, and a glimmer of hope for post-dissertation normalcy. I am also thankful to Mrs Sanaa ElFkihi for her efficient supervising.

I would like to thank my friends for accepting nothing less than excellence from me. Last but not the least, I would like to thank my family: my parents and to my brothers and sister for supporting me spiritually throughout writing this thesis and my life in general.
