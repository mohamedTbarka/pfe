\chapter{Leader Stability}

We have described and proved correct a leader election
algorithm using logical clocks for asynchronous dynamic
networks. A set of circumstances were identified under
which the algorithm does not elect a leader unnecessarily,
but it remains to give a more complete characterization of
such circumstances. Also, the time and message complexity
of the algorithm needs to be analyzed. It would be interest-
ing to compare the efficiency of the algorithm in the cases
of perfect clocks and logical clocks.
